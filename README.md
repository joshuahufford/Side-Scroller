# Side Scroller Game

This game is in its early stages of development and will be released in early December 2017.

My game will consist of a side scroller that will implement a fighting and problem solving aspect.  It will start out with stick figures and allow 2 people to fight their way to the end of the map.

Currently I am in the process getting the base initialized.
