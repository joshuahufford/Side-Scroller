# Side Scroller Game

This game is in its early stages of development and will be released in early December 2017.

I am changing the course of this project from a fighting game to a ball movement game.  It will consist of a ball with a track that you jump over obsticals and try to get as high as you can.  Included will be a start and end to the track and the ability to compete amongst friends to see who can achieve the maximum height.  I will be implimenting real physics on the ball and surroundings.

Please download and test out the game, but currently it is a true work in progress.

Movement on a flat surface is the farthest I have gotten so far.

I will only upload updates if they are in working order.x
